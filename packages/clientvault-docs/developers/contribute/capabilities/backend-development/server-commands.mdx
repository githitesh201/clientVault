## Useful commands

These commands should be executed from packages/clientvault-server folder.
From any other folder you can run `npx nx {command} clientvault-server` (or `npx nx run clientvault-server:{command}`).

### First time setup

```
npx nx database:reset clientvault-server # setup the database with dev seeds
```

### Starting the server

```
npx nx run clientvault-server:start
```

### Lint

```
npx nx run clientvault-server:lint # pass --fix to fix lint errors
```

### Test

```
npx nx run clientvault-server:test:unit          # run unit tests
npx nx run clientvault-server:test:integration   # run integration tests
```
Note: you can run `npx nx run clientvault-server:test:integration:with-db-reset` in case you need to reset the database before running the integration tests.

### Resetting the database

If you want to reset and seed the database, you can run the following command:

```bash
npx nx run clientvault-server:database:reset
```

### Migrations

#### For objects in Core/Metadata schemas (TypeORM)

```bash
npx nx run clientvault-server:typeorm migration:generate src/database/typeorm/core/migrations/nameOfYourMigration -d src/database/typeorm/core/core.datasource.ts
```

#### For Workspace objects

There are no migrations files, migration are generated automatically for each workspace,
stored in the database, and applied with this command

```bash
npx nx run clientvault-server:command workspace:sync-metadata -f
```

<Warning>

This will drop the database and re-run the migrations and seed.

Make sure to back up any data you want to keep before running this command.

</Warning>

## Tech Stack

ClientVault primarily uses NestJS for the backend.

Prisma was the first ORM we used. But in order to allow users to create custom fields and custom objects, a lower-level made more sense as we need to have fine-grained control. The project now uses TypeORM.

Here's what the tech stack now looks like.
