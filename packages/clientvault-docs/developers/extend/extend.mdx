## Overview

ClientVault is designed to be extensible. Use our APIs, webhooks, and app framework to integrate with your existing tools and build custom functionality.

## What You Can Do

- **APIs**: Query and modify your CRM data programmatically using REST or GraphQL
- **Webhooks**: Receive real-time notifications when events occur in ClientVault
- **Apps**: Build custom applications that extend ClientVault's capabilities - Coming soon!
