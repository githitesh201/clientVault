title: Can I Book Meetings from ClientVault?
description: Information about booking meetings directly from ClientVault.

## Current Status

**No, ClientVault does not currently support booking meetings directly from the platform.**

ClientVault's calendar integration is designed to **sync and display** your existing calendar events, not to create new ones. All meeting scheduling should be done through your native calendar application (Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, etc.).

## What You Can Do

- **View meeting history** on People, Companies, and Opportunities records
- **See upcoming meetings** with contacts in your CRM
- **Track meeting context** alongside email communications
- **Auto-create contacts** from meeting participants

## How to Schedule Meetings

1. Use your native calendar app (Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.)
2. Create the meeting as you normally would
3. The meeting will automatically sync to ClientVault within 5 minutes
4. View the meeting on the relevant CRM records

## Future Plans

Meeting creation from within ClientVault is on our roadmap. Join our [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/clientvaulthq/clientvault/discussions) to share your use case and help prioritize this feature.
